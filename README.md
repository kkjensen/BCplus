# BoardComputer+ for E:D

[Binary Downloads](https://github.com/CmdrVasquess/BCplus/releases) –
[Documentation Index](https://cmdrvasquess.github.io/BCplus/)

--------------------

BC+ evaluates the player's journal and serves web pages with useful
informaton. I.e. one can easily access BC+ from any computer, tablet
or smartphone without ATL-TAB'ing away from E:D.

Currnetly information for long distance tarvel is supported - I'm on
the way to Beagle Point. It displays estimations based on the recent
jump history:

As well as the availability of raw materials on scanned bodies in the
current system:

## Installation

BC+ currently is only provided for E:D on PC – though it compliles fine
on Linux (my dev platform). It can be run from any directory as long as
the directory with necessary assets `bcplus.d` is accessible in the same
directory.

If you download the binary distribution, just unpack the ZIP file. This
will create a BCplus folder containing all things you need.

## Running

With a standard E:D installation from Frontier it should be perfectly
fine to just double-click the BCplus.exe. It should find the journal
files in the standard location. If you don't have a standard filesystem
layout, there are some command-line options that let you change
directory paths and other things.

After running the program a web-server is running on your machine (that's
why the windows firewall will ask you if BCplus is permitted to access
the network the first time you run the program). You can open the web 
pages with your local browser on `http://localhost:1337`. If you want to
run the browser on another device in your network you can do so, if you
know how to address your E:D host, e.g. by IP like `192.168.0.2`. Then
you would enter `http://192.168.0.2:1337` in the browser on the other
device. 

### Options

First, option syntax is not Windows standard – BC+ is written in
[GO](https://golang.org) and uses GO's standard command line parsing
package. So be prepared to start options with '-' not '/'.

* `-j <directory>` set the path to the directory containig your journal
  files.

* `-p <port>` set the port on which the web server is listening (default:
  1337).

* `-d <directory>` set the directory where BC+ collects data about your
  commander and the visited galaxy (BC+ can handle multiple commanders)

* `-l` pick up the lates journal file when starting. This is useful if
  you run BC+ after E:D already started to write the journal file.

* `-h` show help information, i.e. the complete and up-to-date list of
  options.

## Credits

1. Thanks to the [GO](https://golang.org) community to provide such a nice
   programming environment (BC+ primarily exists because I neede a project
   to learn GO).

2. Frontier Development for the nice game.

3. [Elite Dangerous Assets](http://edassets.org/) site for providing useful
   visual stuff.

4. Many others I not yet mentioned…
